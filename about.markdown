## Bio
I am a PhD student (predoc) at the MPi-CBG in Dresden, just having started in the beginning of September 2019, so I have a long journey ahead.

I am a biologist by training, having obtained a Bachelor and Master's degree in Evolutionary and Developmental Biology at the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa (FCUL) between 2004-2009.

Afterwards, I joined the Advanced Imaging Facility (AIF) in the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência in Oeiras, Portugal, as a microscopy technician/imaging specialist between 2013 and 2019. During my time at the AIF, my tasks involved teaching new users on how to better use microscopes and optical equipment, performed regular maintenance and repairs, managed the existing resources and was involved in the development of new techniques.

I have acquired experience in several techniques and microscope modalities:
- Dark field and bright field widefield,
- Live sample imaging,
- Scanning confocal,
- Spinning Disk confocal,
- TIRF,
- Multi(2)-photon,
- Lightsheet (SPIM),
- dSTORM,
- Optical Projection Tomography (OPenT)

Due to the nature of my job and exposure to microscope images, I have seen the importance of having a dedicated person in the facility to do image analysis and help researchers analyze their data. This new field of image analysis caught my attention from the beginning, stimulating my curiosity and the new challenge of extracting numerical information from biological images. In addition, I could help accelerate research and work for our facility users and maximize their time at the microscope. As I was exposed to this new area of scientific work, I discovered and was able to participate and co-organize some [Neubias](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/) events and training schools, getting myself involved even more into the growing community of people doing image analysis. Not only was this a big part in my improvement and further increase in expertise in bioimage analysis, but it allowed me to meet wonderful people from all over the world that shared the interest and motivation in this field.
It allowed me to get more involved and discover new interests, leading to my current position as a PhD candidate involved in image analysis.
