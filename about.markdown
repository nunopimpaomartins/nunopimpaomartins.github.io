## Bio
I am a PhD student (predoc) at the MPi-CBG in Dresden, just having started in the beginning of September 2019, so I have a long journey ahead.

Before joining the PhD program in Dresden, I was working at the Advanced Imaging facility of the Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia in Oeiras, Portugal, where I did my part as a microscopy technician/imaging specialist, helping people with their imaging projects between 2013 and 2019.
During my time at the facility, I had the opportunity to work with lots of interesting people and projects, allowing me to learn and use most imaging techniques used nowadays and having plenty of hands-on experience, like:
- Dark field and bright field widefield,
- Live sample imaging,
- Scanning confocal,
- Spinning Disk confocal,
- TIRF,
- Multi(2)-photon,
- Lightsheet (SPIM),
- dSTORM,
- Optical Projection Tomography (OPenT)

In addition to this work and due to demand, I have starting learning and doing Image analysis of Bioimages (2017), in order to help users of the facility to obtain data from their images and to maximize their time at the microscopes, trying to avoid the most common mistakes and problems that can arise from imaging. Due to this interest in image analysis, I was able to participate and co-organize some [Neubias](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/) events and training schools, which is a big source of knowledge and expertise for image analysis and microscopy as well. This was a big part in my improvement and further increase in expertise in bioimage analysis.
